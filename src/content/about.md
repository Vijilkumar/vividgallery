### Hi, I'm Vijilkumar 👋

Capturing a moment through my lens always fills my heart with joy.Perhaps that single frame will one day whisper a new meaning to our lives,as we turn the pages of memory and relive our diaries in light and time. 📷✨

I have over 7 years of experience as a photographer, specializing in landscape, travel, and portrait photography. Over the past 2 years, I have also expanded my work to include wedding and corporate event coverage. My approach to photography centers on finding the extraordinary in ordinary moments. I believe that beauty exists
everywhere – in urban streets, remote wilderness, and human connections. My goal is to capture these fleeting instances
in a way that allows viewers to see the world through a different lens.

By profession, I am an IT professional, and at heart, a passionate traveler. Holding a camera in my hand gives me the confidence to explore more, observe deeply, and connect with the world around me. Through my photography, I strive to capture fleeting moments and present them in a way that invites viewers to see the world through a different lens.
